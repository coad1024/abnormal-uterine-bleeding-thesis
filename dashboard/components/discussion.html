                    <p>The study's finding that the 31-40 age group is most affected by AUB aligns with numerous other studies. Similarly, menorrhagia being the most common complaint (40.5%) is a consistent finding in the literature, reinforcing its status as a primary symptom driving gynecological consultations.</p>

                    <p>The predominance of normal cyclical changes (secretory and proliferative phases) is a common observation. However, the presence of endometrial hyperplasia in 12% of cases and carcinoma in 1.4% highlights the critical diagnostic role of endometrial sampling, especially as these rates are comparable to other regional studies.</p>

                    <p>The strong correlation between histopathology and LMP (r=0.766) is a key finding, emphasizing that clinical context is vital for accurate interpretation. Conversely, the lack of correlation between symptoms and pathology is a crucial takeaway, confirming that histopathology is indispensable as symptoms alone are poor predictors of the underlying condition.</p>

                "The findings of this study underscore the importance of histopathological examination in the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding, especially in women over 40 years. Despite the prevalence of normal cyclical changes, the significant rate of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma warrants thorough investigation of all AUB cases."
