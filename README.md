# Histopathological Patterns in Abnormal Uterine Bleeding - A Thesis

This repository contains the complete research thesis, "Histopathological Patterns in Abnormal Uterine Bleeding," along with all supplementary materials, including the dataset, figures, and final manuscript.

## Introduction

Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) is a common and significant health issue affecting women across different age groups. This research provides a comprehensive analysis of the various histopathological patterns found in the endometrial samples of patients presenting with AUB.

The primary objective of this study is to correlate these pathological findings with key clinical parameters such as age, menstrual history (LMP), parity, and hormonal drug intake. By identifying significant patterns and relationships, this work aims to enhance the diagnostic and management strategies for AUB.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several directories to ensure that all research materials are easy to locate and access:

-   **`/data`**: Includes the raw dataset (`Masterchart.xlsx`) used for the statistical analysis in this study.
-   **`/figures`**: A collection of all figures, charts, and histopathological images referenced in the manuscript.
-   **`/final_outputs`**: The final, compiled versions of the thesis and synopsis in PDF format.
-   **`/website`**: The source code for the accompanying Quartz-based research website that presents this work.
-   **`/scripts`**: Contains any scripts used for data processing or analysis.
-   **`/archive`**: Miscellaneous or archived files that are not part of the main thesis but are preserved for reference.

## Key Findings

-   The study identifies the prevalence of various histopathological patterns in AUB, ranging from normal cyclical changes to endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma.
-   A strong positive correlation was found between histopathological diagnosis and the last menstrual period (LMP), highlighting the importance of menstrual history in interpreting endometrial histology.
-   A significant correlation was also observed between histopathological findings and patient age, indicating that pathological changes are more common in older age groups.
-   The research underscores that clinical symptoms alone are not reliable predictors of underlying endometrial pathology, reinforcing the need for routine histopathological evaluation.
